				A content repository is composed of a number of workspaces. Workspace is a term used by several software vendors for applications that allow users to exchange and organize files over the Internet. In the simplest case, a repository just consists of a workspace. In more complex case, a repository consists of more than one workspace. Each workspace contains a single rooted tree item. The “repository” repository contains three workspaces, includes: system, backup and collaboration workspace.

		 <section id="sect-User_Guide-Terminologies-Node">
			<title>Node</title>
			 <para>
				A node is an abstract basic unit used to build linked data structures, such as linked lists and trees, and computer-based representation of graphs. Nodes contain data and/or links to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers or references.
			</para>
			 <para>
				A node can be thought of as a logical placeholder for data. It is a memory block which contains some data unit, and optionally a reference to some other data, which may be another node that contains other data. By linking one node with other interlinked nodes, very large and complex data structure can be formed.
			</para>

		</section>
		
		 <section id="sect-User_Guide-Terminologies-Version">
			<title>Version</title>
			 <para>
				Versioning means that at any given time the node's state can be saved for possible future recovery and the action of saving called 'checking in'. A workspace may contain both versionable and non-versionable nodes. A node is versionable if it has been assigned a mixin type mixin: versionable; otherwise, it is a nonversionable node. A version exists as a part of a version history graph that describes the predecessor/successor relations among versions of a particular versionable node.

			 <para>
				Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of electronic information, whether or not this information is actually computer software.

		 <section id="sect-User_Guide-Terminologies-WebDAV">
			<title>WebDAV</title>
			 <para>
				WebDAV stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning. It is a set of extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote World Wide Web servers.
			</para>
			 <para>
				The protocol was to make the Web a readable and writable medium. It provides functionality to create, change and move documents on a remote server (typically a web server or "web share"). This is useful for, among other things, authoring the documents which a web server serves, but can also be used for general web-based file storage that can be accessed from anywhere.
